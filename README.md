# hello-world

Hi

I've done a bit of programming in C# and worked with ASP.NET previously also so I'm familar with coding and web development to an extent, but funnily enough I have never used Git or GitHub. I am diving in so I can add it to my toolbox as I hopefully progress further into development.

I have been using the spare time I have due to the recent Covid-19 'lockdown' we are experiencing in the UK to learn some more skills so I have signed up to a couple of coding bootcamps.

Wish me luck!

Craig.
